# InteractiveDev-Assignment01-BandWebsite

This is a website of an artist. This website has been improved to be more refined and simplified to enhance user experience. This website aims to give fans of this artist a closer look into the artist and his personality. It provides fans with more information about their favourite artists, such as their socials, update on the latest music videos, the artist's life updates as well as merchandise. This gives fans a closer connection and support their favourite artist.
 
## Design Process

While designing this website, I considered important factors such as user experience, user design, website functions. The factor that I chose to focus on the most is building a good user experience. The goal was to make users feel welcomed and engaged while using the website to not only improve their experience but to strengthn the fanbase. 

In order to achieve this goal, I used simple colors that fit the artist and his theme while maintaining a tidy webpage. I made use of transitions to make the website feel more responsive and less jittery. The menus are also ordered and structured in a way that makes navigating around the website intuitive and easy. The use of playable videos also made the website more engaging as users can get a taste of the artist's videos without having to open a new tab. These are some things I considered and implemented to cater this website to fans of this artist.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
