# InteractiveDev-Assignment01-BandWebsite

This is a website of an artist. This website has been improved to be more refined and simplified to enhance user experience. This website aims to give fans of this artist a closer look into the artist and his personality. It provides fans with more information about their favourite artists, such as their socials, update on the latest music videos, the artist's life updates as well as merchandise. This gives fans a closer connection and support their favourite artist.
 
## Design Process

While designing this website, I considered important factors such as user experience, user design, website functions. The factor that I chose to focus on the most is building a good user experience. The goal was to make users feel welcomed and engaged while using the website to not only improve their experience but to strengthn the fanbase. 

In order to achieve this goal, I used simple colors that fit the artist and his theme while maintaining a tidy webpage. I made use of transitions to make the website feel more responsive and less jittery. The menus are also ordered and structured in a way that makes navigating around the website intuitive and easy. The use of playable videos also made the website more engaging as users can get a taste of the artist's videos without having to open a new tab. These are some things I considered and implemented to cater this website to fans of this artist.
